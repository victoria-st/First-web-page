            <p>The Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit for the American and international film industry.</p>
            
            <p>The awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious, significant awards in the entertainment industry
            worldwide. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an
            international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The
            various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy, officially called the "Academy Award of
            Merit", although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the "Oscar". The statuette depicts a knight rendered in the
            Art Deco style.
            </p>
            
            <p>The award was originally sculpted by George Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons. AMPAS first presented it
            in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks in The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as
            the 1st Academy Awards. The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the
            first time in 1953. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide. It
            is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards; its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for
            television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards. A
            total of 3,140 Oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in 1929. They are widely cited as the most
            prestigious and renowned competitive awards in the field of entertainment.
